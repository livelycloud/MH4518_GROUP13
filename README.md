Final Code Files for simulations:
- Simuate Interest Rates:
    - everything under "interest rate model"
- Generate Random Variables: "/random_variable/generate_rv.ipynb"
- Generate Simulations of price paths:
    - For each set of the generated random variables, run "stock_pricing/simulate_given_rv.py
    - (The GBM model is defined in "stock_pricing/multi_asset_GBM.py")
- For product pricing:
    - For each set of simulated price paths, run "product_structure.py"
- Simulationg of Greek values: "greeks/greeks_simulation.ipynb"
